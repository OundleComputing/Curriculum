<p><em>Repository</em> - Repositories are where you store each of your different projects. For example you might have one Repository called Website which contains a Website you are working on. You might also have another called Python Programs - containing (unsurprisingly!) All of your Python Programs.</p>
<p>Repositories can be created locally (on your computer) and then synchronised with GitHub so that you can work on them elsewhere by cloning and others can do this too</p>

<h3>
<a id="init" class="anchor" href="#init" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commands -Creating a Repository (Local)</h3>

<p><em>git init</em> - this creates a local repository. Make sure you are in a suitable directory - probably best to have your own GitHub folder in your H: drive</p>
<h4>These 3 commands concurrently will upload all local changes to the selected repository</h4>
<p><em>git add *</em> - this creates a local repository. Make sure you are in a suitable directory - probably best to have your own GitHub folder in your H: drive</p>
<p><em>git commit -m "comment"</em> - this creates a local repository. Make sure you are in a suitable directory - probably best to have your own GitHub folder in your H: drive</p>
<p><em>git git push</em> - this creates a local repository. Make sure you are in a suitable directory - probably best to have your own GitHub folder in your H: drive</p>
